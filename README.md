## Synopsis/Project details
This website is created to make it easier for the content creators to sell merchandise online, and for customers to buy with less hassle. This website has been integrated with payment gateway and has a simple UI for great user experience. We had used some of the core azure services like Static Webapps, containers, storage and Visual Studio Code.

Website url: https://frtmerchwebsite.z13.web.core.windows.net/

For deploying a static webapp using Azure Static web app service we have to make a resource group in my case it was "FRT-demo" and connect to github account in order to access repositories. Azure creates a github actions .yaml file in ".github/Workflows/ " which automatically detects a new commit and run a github actions workflow and the changes reflects on the actual website.
